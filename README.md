# ao3_main_character_finder
A web scraper that finds and opens every AO3 fic that tags your favorite character first

One day I snapped, just snapped, and wrote this to save myself infinite scrolling. It's not fast because AO3 doesn't have an API, but is IS faster than you physically scrolling through the search results.
